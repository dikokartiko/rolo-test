# Rolo - Context

## Current Status
The "Overall Catalogue" page has been implemented and is now pixel-perfect.
The "Shopping Cart" page has been implemented, including its route, UI, and integration with the Header component.
The header button styling has been updated to reflect cart status based on Figma designs.

## Next Steps
- The "Customer Details" page has been refined to be pixel-perfect and responsive, with form validation and Google Sheets integration.
- The "Checkout" page has been redesigned to match the Figma specifications, including a two-column layout, a Rolo logo, and a functional promotion code input.
- The payment flow is now fully functional after fixing a Stripe metadata issue, a missing Elements provider on the completion page, and a duplicate key error in the product details.
- The completion page has been updated to include a "Back to Home" button and a 10-second redirect.
