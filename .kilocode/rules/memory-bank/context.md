# Rolo - Context

## Current Status
The "Overall Catalogue" page has been implemented and is now pixel-perfect.
The "Shopping Cart" page has been implemented, including its route, UI, and integration with the Header component.
The header button styling has been updated to reflect cart status based on Figma designs.

## Next Steps
- Implement the "Item Details Page".
- Add `React.use()` unwrapping for `params` in `src/app/catalogue/[productId]/page.tsx`.
- Fixed React rendering issue in `src/components/ProductDetails.tsx`.
